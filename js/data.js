If you are ordering from anywhere other then the US you must send us payment in USD currency.\r\n\r\nWe will begin processing your order as soon as we receive payment. This means if you are mailing payment, or use an e-check the payment has to not only arrive to us, but also clear before we will begin going into production on your order. We ask if you are mailing payment to let us know when you have mailed it so we can keep an eye out for it. We will let you know when it arrives, and if it needs to clear when it has cleared.\r\n\r\nWe are also not responsible for any lost payments in the mail, so send it safely!\r\n\r\nYou have 14 days to pay for an item before it will be re-listed and the transaction cancelled. If any problems arise let us know and we will see if there is anything we can workout.\r\n","policy_shipping":"Increase in shipping rates! The USPS has increased it&#39;s rates this year, domestic parcels aren&#39;t much higher, but International rates have gone up by at least 60%. We do our best to keep our rates as low as possible, but there isn&#39;t much more we can do.\r\n\r\nOur Rates:\r\nWe ship glass, and other heavy sometimes fragile items. This means it can get quite expensive. We pack everything as best as we can but that means more weight and sometimes heavier boxes. If we find a cheaper way to ship we will lower our rates, but until they they have to stay where they are, and I promise you most times we eat 30% of the costs.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUSA\/Domestic:\r\nWe ship USPS First Class, which can be up to 5-7 business days. You have the option to upgrade to either priority (2-3 day) or Express shipping (next day). These all have an upgrade cost so please message me ahead of time so I can quote you the rates.\r\nWe also DO NOT OFFER TRACKING unless asked before the item has been marked shipped. If you need a tracking number please let us know when you make your purchase.\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t give any &quot;guarantee delivery date&quot; because a lot of things can effect shipping times. Weather, holidays, ext. We however will do our best to get your package to you as soon as possible.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nWe ship USPS airmail This is USUALLY 10-14 business days with no tracking. HOWEVER depending on your countries customs regulations they can take up to 3 MONTHS. We are in no way liable for items that are held up in customs, I&#39;m sorry it is a risk we all take when we order overseas. We can upgrade your shipping to Priority (6-10day with tracking) but once again These times can&#39;t be guaranteed with orders being held up in customs.\r\nIf you would like to upgrade your parcel to Priority you must let us know before the item has been marked shipped, and the parcel won&#39;t be shipped out until the shipping upgrade has been purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms Fee and Charges:\r\nFor international orders, the shipping charges ONLY cover the cost of postage and not any customs fees, charges, or duties that may need to be paid. Please be aware of the customs regulations for your country prior to purchase, and contact the shops prior to purchase to ensure a smooth shipping experience.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLOST\/DELAYED PACKAGES:\r\nWe are not responsible for delayed\/lost packages, purely because the cause of the delay is completely out of our control. We will work with you the best that we can to figure out a solution for the problem, but we won&#39;t refund item\/shipping for delayed packages. A way around this is tracking, it lets both of us see where the packages have been and get them to you faster if there is an issue. We don&#39;t automatically offer tracking but if it is shipped within the USA we can add it on for free, just let us know before the item is marked shipped. For tracking on International orders you must upgrade to Priority shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you think your package is lost please contact us, this is an incredibly rare occurance, but we will work with you the best way we can to figure out a solution.\r\n\r\n*********Once again International buyers please keep in mind our packages usually get to you in 14 business days but they can be delayed by as much as 3 months depending on if they are held up in customs!***********************\r\n\r\nAgain if you have any questions or concerns contact us!","policy_refunds":"Return Policies are as follows:\r\n\r\n-No returns on any stickers, Vinyl Decals, or bumper stickers\r\n-Returns are accepted on glassware (excluding custom items, limited edition sets,clearance and upcycled products) 5 business days after item was received (or 7 days after item was purchased, whichever is longer). items MUST be in original condition to receive money back.

Once item has been received a refund will be authorized.\r\n-Clearance and upcycled products, and Limited edition sets are all final sale.\r\n-All custom orders, orders with added messages, names are all final sale\r\n\r\nIf you receive a damaged item all we require is a picture of the damaged glass. This must be provided no longer then 24 hours after the order has been received. Pictures of the packaging may also be required. We won&#39;t ask you to waste your time shipping it back to us, a picture works great and we will get you a replacement glass shipped out within 3 business days.\r\n","policy_additional":"Absolutely every glass we make to order. this takes at least 3-5 days for us to cut our stencils, affix them, sandblast, clean polish and pack. We do all of this Mondays-Saturdays (we take Sunday&#39;s off) so it usually takes a week until we ship out your glass. If you need the glass sooner, the best way is to contact us before you place your order, and we will make sure to do is ASAP.However if you place your order, and don&#39;t notify that you might need it by a certain timeframe it can take up to a week to ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tend to recycle boxes we feel would be suitable\/strong enough to ship to you. So sometimes you might get a straight cardboard box,or maybe something else a little more primitive. If you would prefer a standard cardboard box please feel free to ask and we will be happy to oblige.\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1424125853,"vacation_autoreply":"We are taking a much needed vacation!\r\nBe back soon!","url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/FanArtGlassware?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":null,"num_favorers":896,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/071\/0\/8083699\/isla_fullxfull.16077764_jvtm42w7.jpg"}},{"listing_id":208931344,"state":"active","user_id":53317163,"category_id":69150425,"title":"Groomsmen Gift \u2013 Personalized Whiskey Decanter \u2013 Engraved","description":"Groomsmen Gift, Personalized Whiskey Decanter.

Sometimes issues can occur such as mis-routing, weather conditions in states your package may route through, holidays, etc. Major holidays such as CHRISTMAS can incur much longer shipping times.\r\n\r\nIf you have received your shipping notification from PayPal and\/or Etsy allow up to 8 shipping days and then notify us.

You will need to be patient and work with us during this process. USPS can sometimes forget to scan an item when they become busy. It does not mean that it&#39;s really lost or never shipped.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a shipping notice from both Etsy and PayPal. Sometimes these can end up in your SPAM folders. Please check there. If you should not receive your order, notification must be within 10 days of the shipping notice &quot;SENT&quot; date.

You will need to be patient and work with us during this process. USPS can sometimes forget to scan an item when they become busy.

You will need to be patient and work with us during this process. USPS can sometimes forget to scan an item when they become busy. It does not mean that it&#39;s really lost or never shipped.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a shipping notice from both Etsy and PayPal. Sometimes these can end up in your SPAM folders. Please check there. If you should not receive your order, notification must be within 10 days of the shipping notice &quot;SENT&quot; date.

If your package is not located after investigation period we will proceed with the following. If we have insured your package you will be REQUIRED to sign an affidavit.

We will be checking the tracking daily to see if your package has started to move toward it&#39;s destination before determining it is possibly LOST IN TRANSIT. You will need to be patient and work with us during this process. USPS can sometimes forget to scan an item when they become busy. It does not mean that it&#39;s really lost or never shipped.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a shipping notice from both Etsy and PayPal. Sometimes these can end up in your SPAM folders. Please check there. If you should not receive your order, notification must be within 10 days of the shipping notice &quot;SENT&quot; date. Exceptions are international orders in which case you have 45 days from Shipping Notice &quot;SENT&quot; date to notify us. We will do everything we can to track your delivery. Please be patient while we work to track it down.\r\n\r\nIf your package is LOST sufficient time must be allowed for the USPS investigation to check the status of your package. While they attempt to locate it. We will fill out USPS MISSING MAIL forms. We then allow 5-10 days to see if your package has been located and is moving in transit once again. If your package is not located after investigation period we will proceed with the following. If we have insured your package you will be REQUIRED to sign an affidavit. Refunds\/Replacements will occur after insurance affidavits are signed (if required) and filled out by purchaser (you) and have been submitted to the insurer.\r\n\r\n**DAMAGED MERCHANDISE**\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\nContact us Immediately on receipt of package.
